# Banking System OOP Challenge
Friday, 07 November, 2025

## Problem Statement

Design and implement a banking system in Dart that demonstrates all four pillars of ObjectOriented Programming.
The system should support multiple account types with different
rules and behaviors.

## Requirements

1. ### Create an abstract base class BankAccount that includes:

- Private fields for account number, account holder name, and balance
- Abstract methods for withdraw() and deposit()
- A method to display account information
- Proper encapsulation with getters/setters

2. ### Implement three types of accounts that inherit from BankAccount:

#### SavingsAccount:

- Minimum balance requirement of $500
- 2% interest calculation method
- Withdrawal limit of 3 transactions per month

#### CheckingAccount:

- No minimum balance
- $35 overdraft fee if balance goes below $0
- No withdrawal limits

#### PremiumAccount:

- Minimum balance of $10,000
- 5% interest calculation
- Unlimited free withdrawals

3. ### Create an interface/abstract class InterestBearing for accounts that earn interest

4. ### Implement a Bank class that can:

- Create new accounts
- Find accounts by account number
- Transfer money between accounts
- Generate reports of all accounts
  Expected Implementation Structure
  The complete implementation code is provided as a reference. Students should study this
  structure and understand how each OOP principle is demonstrated.

# Questions to Answer

1. **Identify and explain** how each OOP principle is demonstrated in this code:

- a) Where is encapsulation used and why?
- b) How does inheritance help in this design?
- c) Give examples of polymorphism in action
- d) What role does abstraction play?

2. **Extend the system** by adding:

- a) A StudentAccount class with no fees and a maximum balance of $5,000
- b) A method to calculate and apply monthly interest to all interest-bearing accounts
- c) Transaction history tracking for each account

3. **Refactor suggestion:** How would you improve the error handling and validation in
   this system?
